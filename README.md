# High-Pressure-Hydrogen-Electrolyser

# 1. Objective
The aim of this project is to understand, design, and develop a high-pressure Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, with a special focus on the bipolar plate (BPP)—a critical component for performance, safety, and durability. The project integrates electrochemical, mechanical, and material design aspects, with emphasis on corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity, and manufacturability.

# 2. Working Principle of PEM Electrolyzer
* A PEM electrolyzer splits water (H₂O) into hydrogen (H₂) and oxygen (O₂) using electrical energy.
* Anode Reaction (OER): 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻
* Cathode Reaction (HER): 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂
* The PEM (solid polymer membrane) conducts protons while preventing gas crossover.

# 3. Experimental Setup & Design
* Compact Cell Design: 9 cm² active area to minimize flow and thermal gradients.
* Catalysts: IrO₂ at the anode, Pt at the cathode.
* GDL & Flow Fields: Porous titanium for efficient gas/water movement.
* Structure: Gold-coated stainless steel parts to resist corrosion.
* Conditions: Operates at 70°C and up to 100 bar pressure, allowing hydrogen compression without external equipment.
* Sensors: Monitors pressure, temperature, and water levels for safe and optimized performance.

# 4. Focus Area: Bipolar Plate (BPP) Design
The BPP performs multiple functions:
* Conducts electricity between cells.
* Distributes gases and water.
* Removes reaction products.
* Maintains thermal and mechanical stability.
* Prevents gas mixing.

Design Criteria:
* Material: Titanium for high corrosion resistance; stainless steel as a cheaper alternative with coatings.
* Coatings: Gold, TiN, CrN used to reduce corrosion and interface resistance.
* Flow Field Design: Parallel and metal foam structures explored for better reactant distribution and thermal conductivity.
 
# 5. Corrosion Challenges
Metallic BPPs (especially stainless steel) corrode in acidic, high-temperature environments, forming oxide layers that increase interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and reduce efficiency.
* Causes: Acidic media, low pH, high voltage, and uneven current distribution.
* Corrosion is more severe at the anode due to oxygen evolution and steeper pH drop.

# 6. Solutions Explored
* Protective Coatings: Gold, TiN, CrN applied via PVD, sputtering, and chromizing.
* Material Testing: SEM and EDX used to detect coating defects like pinholes.
* Durability Models: Predict coating lifespan without long experiments.
* Surface Treatments: Chromizing, nitriding, and carburizing improve corrosion resistance and electrical contact.

# 7. Project Understanding & Conclusion
The study highlights the critical role of bipolar plates in PEM electrolyzers—balancing performance, cost, and durability. While titanium remains ideal for corrosion resistance, coated stainless steel presents a viable low-cost alternative. Designing an efficient BPP that handles high-pressure operation while minimizing corrosion and resistive losses is key to the success of this hydrogen electrolyzer system.
